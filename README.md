# Stacks_Queues
 
 Q: how can/should I visualize A Stack?:
 A: we can think of them as plates and as the structure grows
    it grows vertically or along the 'y' axis. 
    we can only access the latest stacked plate or the very top of 'y' || 'n'th stacked plate, which means when accessing this datastructure 'stack' we move through it top down, or latest to first this is known as 'LIFO'

Q: Can we expand on LIFO?: 
A: It is 'Last in, First Out' ; which is to say The last item in is the first item taken out || or latest item propagated from the stacks root is the first to be read/accessed
