# Stacks_Queues
 
 Q: how can/should I visualize A Stack?:
 A: we can think of them as plates and as the structure grows
    it grows vertically or along the 'y' axis. 
    we can only access the latest stacked plate or the very top of 'y' || 'n'th stacked plate, which means when accessing this datastructure 'stack' we move through it top down, or latest to first this is known as 'LIFO'

Q: Can we expand on LIFO?: 
A: It is 'Last in, First Out' ; which is to say The last item in is the first item taken out || or latest item propagated from the stacks root is the first to be read/accessed

Q: Run-time(s) of stack operations? 
A: lookup O(n) ( because the stack can grow to n size ),
   pop O(1), push O(1), peek O(1)

Q: what are the main methods used against stacks?:
A: pop, push, peek

Q: what does stack.pop() do?:
A: remove last item from stack

Q: what does stack.push() do?:
A: add a plate to the end of the stack stack
   or top of stack 

Q: where do we see stacks in other places?
A: in lang specific engines ( stack-overflow ),
   within functions, browser-history
